                <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p>I am a second year undergraduate student currently pursuing Bachelor in Technology (B.Tech) in Computer Science and Engineering from ABES Engineering college, Ghaziabad, India.
                 I have a keen interest in learning new things like the programming languages etc, and I really like competetive programming and I keep on practicing my codes at different popular websites.
                 Other than this, I like reading, writing, drawing, walking and eating (lol..).
                 And I'm also decent in picture-editing as I have a good acquaintance with PicsArt, Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom.
                 The motto of my life is to constantly improve myself by learning from the mistakes of the past and taking every task as a challenge.
                 <br class="ready"> READY, AIM, FIRE !
